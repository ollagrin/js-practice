          <p class="paragraph">
            Tartaglia describes himself as "kind of a bad guy", living for the
            thrill of a fight and causing chaos. As a child, Tartaglia was
            frightened and hesitant, but he secretly desired to become an
            adventurer like the ones his father told him about as they fished
            together. After falling into The Abyss and meeting and training with
            Skirk, Tartaglia's personality drastically changed. Although he
            appears to relatively friendly on the surface, Tartaglia is a
            bloodthirsty warrior. The Abyss and his old master, Skirk, made him
            self-confident, solipsistic, and brash, thriving on the sensation of
            being alive. A warrior at heart, he constantly seeks ways to grow
            stronger, regardless of how he obtains said power. Tartaglia
            considers those who wish to become strong like him to be friends and
            takes pleasure in battling them on the battlefield. He lusts for
            combat and grows excited by fighting strong opponents, even if it
            could mean dying in the process. He uses bows because he is weakest
            with them, making his victories with them all the more exhilarating
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Because of his pride, Tartaglia is exceptionally reliable at
            accomplishing the tasks given to him, no matter how difficult they
            may be or if they go against his values. This, combined with his
            straightforward nature, makes him rather easy to manipulate. Despite
            disliking how his plan in Liyue Harbor could potentially harm
            innocents, he puts it into motion to fulfill his mission in Liyue —
            only to learn he was meant to fail as part of an even larger plan he
            was not privy to, much to his consternation.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Amongst the rest of the Harbingers, Tartaglia is considered an
            oddball. While his fellow Harbingers prefer clandestine operations
            and staying behind the scenes, Tartaglia favors being front and
            center. He is a public figure known for attending social gatherings
            and even participates as an actor in plays and theater. As a result,
            Childe's coworkers are wary of him, while he holds them in disdain
            for their schemes and "intangible" methods. While he is easily
            capable of scheming, he only resorts to such approaches when
            necessary due to his straightforward nature. He also appears to
            treat his subordinates less harshly than the rest of the Harbingers,
            stating that he doesn't use lethal force against the recruits in his
            care nor does he threaten any of them.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Tartaglia dedicates himself to those he cares about wholeheartedly.
            He is unquestionably loyal to the Tsaritsa and holds her in high
            esteem, seeing himself as her weapon of war. He also cares deeply
            for his family; he sends money, gifts, and letters home often.
            Tartaglia is exceptionally proud of his three younger siblings and
            dotes on them frequently, especially his youngest brother Teucer —
            he is willing to lie and even put himself in mortal danger, so as
            long as it makes him happy. Although he was once on good terms with
            Zhongli (even allowing the former Archon to use him as financial
            support), he seems to have taken his deception personally, stating
            he will only forgive him if he agrees to trial by combat. Zhongli
            appears to be unaware of Tartaglia's change in opinion, being under
            the impression he will still meet him for drinks to catch up after
            the recent Liyue events.
