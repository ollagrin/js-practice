              making him extremely dangerous despite being the youngest member.

            Despite holding one of the most senior positions in the Fatui as one
            of the Eleven Harbingers, Childe very much looks like the young
            adult that he still is. He is a wolf in sheep's clothing, however,
            for under the cheerful and confident appearance lies a deadly
            swordsman. He is the youngest among the Harbingers, but one of the
            most dangerous among their number. That said, Childe doesn't seem to
            fit in well with the others. As a fighter first and foremost, he is
            quite at odds with this organization of deceit and treachery.

            Many myths in Snezhnaya say that Tartaglia has been on the
            battlefield since he was 14 years old. Oddly enough, at that young
            age he already seemed to be a skilled slaughterer with mastery of
            many forms of martial arts. But more terrifying than his skill in
            combat was his passion for it. Perilous battles would only excite
            him, and terrifying foes would exhilarate him all the more. Childe's
            arrogance and conceit are derived from honing himself across
            countless battles, and from unmatched combat experience. On the
            other hand, because they fret about the way his quarrelsome
            personality tends to invite unwanted trouble, the other Harbingers
            constantly try to get him sent on missions to places as far from
            Snezhnaya as possible, so that they can avoid the fallout. The man
            is incomprehensibly ever in the eye of the storm, and these unusual
            experiences have also made him quite the show-off who revels in the
            praise of others. Unlike other members of the Harbingers, who prefer
            to keep a low profile, Tartaglia will often go to watch public
            performances â€” occasionally even becoming part of the show himself.

          <p class="paragraph">
            Unlike what the rest of the world may think, Tartaglia was not born
            with his exceptional skills in battle. But he would never speak to
            everyone about that critical fateful encounter of his... When he was
            14, he fled his monotonous life at home with nothing but a
            shortsword and a bag of bread in hand. That 14-year-old boy got lost
            in the snowy forest. Pursued by bears and wolf packs, he lost his
            footing and fell into a bottomless crack in the earth's surface.
            There, he witnessed the endless possibilities of another ancient
            world. There, he would meet a mysterious swordswoman... Or perhaps
            one should say that this dark realm had sensed the burning ambition
            in this boy's heart. This darkness was something that the Harbinger
            Childe could never again delve into. In those three months, the
            swordswoman taught Tartaglia how to pass through the Abyss
            unhindered, and more importantly, nurtured the ability to stir up
            endless havoc from within Ajax's trouble-mongering nature. No one
            knew what happened within that darkness during those three months,
            nor would Ajax ever speak of this to anyone. When his worried mother
            and sisters finally found him in that forest, only 3 days had passed
            in this world. Thus did Ajax's first adventure end, with his
            now-rusty shortsword in hand. This would mark the end of his youth
            and the beginning of his days as a warrior.
